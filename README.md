# blindaids
A simple device that can help blind people walk easier, using other stimuli to represent the objects around 

<b> Short Description </b>

	The device helps the blind people to interact with objects around them, notifying them when an object is in the close range. The device is able to measure precise distances from about 2m away.
	 Once an object is found on that range, the device activates the notification state, turning on one or two vibration motors depending on where the obstacle is. It features two UltraSonic sensors, one for the right and one for the left. 
	These sensors send an ultrasonic sound wave and wait for it to come back, measuring the time it took to travel. The brain of the device is the ATmega328P Microcontroller placed in an Arduino Nano 328P Configuration.
	 The device is battery powered, it features three 18650 Li-Ion Cells connected in series to accomodate the minimul Vin of the Arduino Nano328P board.
